                <p>Scaffolds are a core concept in medicinal chemistry and they can be the focus of multiple
                    independent development efforts, over an extended period. Thus, scaffold associated
                    properties can vary over time, possibly showing consistently increasing or decreasing trends.
                    We posit that such trends characterize the attention that the community pays to a scaffold.</p>
                <p>This application allows you to query <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/">ChEMBL</a>
                    for a scaffold (represented as a SMILES) and visualize properties of the compounds containing
                    the scaffold over time. This functionality is analogous to
                    <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/">Google Trends</a>.</p>
                <p>Currently the properties considered are</p>

                <p>As you might expect, very small or commonly occurring scaffolds can result in long
                    query times. We currently employ some simple heuristics to avoid querying for such
                    cases.</p>
