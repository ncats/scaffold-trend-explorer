                    <p>The Scaffold Trend Explorer helps you look at property trends for a scaffold (or more generally,
                        any substructure) over time. Currently a
                        small set of properties are considered. See <a href="@controllers.routes.Application.about()">here</a>
                        for a description of the properties available. You can visually compare trends for multiple
                        (upto 9) scaffolds simultaneously and download the trend data for individual scaffolds or all of
                        them at one go. Use the bookmarks to quickly access the SMILES for well known scaffolds.
                    </p>
                    <p>Note that for small scaffolds, query times can be long, and as a result, we don't allow searches
                        to be run using benzene or straight chain alkanes (7 or fewer carbons) as queries.
